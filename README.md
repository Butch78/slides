# Slidev Workspace Starter

This starter helps you manage multiple **Slidev** presentations in a single monorepo. Since each Slidev project is an independent package, using a **pnpm workspace** makes it easy to manage, develop, and deploy them together.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Workspace-friendly**: Manage all your Slidev presentations as separate packages within a single workspace.
- **Automated deployment**: Use GitHub Actions to automatically deploy each presentation to GitHub Pages.
- **Easy to scale**: Quickly add new Slidev projects by creating new packages in the workspace.
