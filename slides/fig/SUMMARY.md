# Fig Platform - Executive Summary & Recommendations

## Overview

Fig is a serverless data platform that combines **hot storage** (PlanetScale/Postgres), **CDC streaming** (RisingWave), and **intelligent cold storage** (Cloudflare R2 + Apache Iceberg) to eliminate data engineering complexity while providing sub-50ms operational queries and seconds-scale petabyte analytics.

Inspired by Cloudflare's R2 SQL architecture, Fig uses **intelligent metadata pruning** to skip 99%+ of data before reading a single byte, enabling serverless queries over petabytes without managing clusters.

## Key Value Propositions

### 1. **Zero Data Engineering**
- No ETL pipelines to build
- No clusters to manage (Spark, Trino, Presto)
- No capacity planning
- Automatic hot/cold tiering via CDC

### 2. **Performance Without Compromise**
- **Hot queries:** <50ms (operational workloads)
- **Cold queries:** Seconds (petabyte-scale analytics)
- **CDC lag:** Sub-second replication

### 3. **Cost Efficiency**
- **80%+ cheaper** than Snowflake/Databricks
- Pay only for data processed, not idle clusters
- Zero egress fees (R2 vs. S3)
- Open formats (no vendor lock-in)

### 4. **Infinite Scale**
- Hot tier: Terabytes (operational data)
- Cold tier: Petabytes (historical data)
- Query engine: Auto-scales to query complexity
- Built on Cloudflare's global edge

## Technical Innovation: Metadata Pruning

The core innovation is **three-level intelligent pruning** using Apache Iceberg metadata:

```
Query: "Find all HTTP 500 errors on June 15, 2024"

Traditional Approach (Spark/Trino):
1. Read all files for June
2. Filter in memory
3. Return results
→ Read: 100GB, Time: 5 minutes

Fig Approach:
1. Partition pruning: Skip all days except June 15 (manifest list)
2. File pruning: Skip files where max(status) < 500 (manifest files)
3. Row group pruning: Skip row groups without status=500 (Parquet footers)
→ Read: 80MB (99.9% pruned), Time: 0.8 seconds
```

**Impact:** Query petabytes in seconds by reading only megabytes.

## Architecture at a Glance

```
Application Writes → Postgres (Hot) → RisingWave CDC → R2 Iceberg (Cold)
                          ↓                                    ↓
                     Hot Queries                         Cold Queries
                     (<50ms)                          (seconds via pruning)
```

### Hot Tier (PlanetScale/Postgres)
- **Purpose:** Recent data, operational queries
- **Retention:** 30-90 days (configurable)
- **Latency:** Sub-50ms
- **Scale:** Terabytes

### CDC Tier (RisingWave)
- **Purpose:** Real-time replication hot → cold
- **Technology:** Streaming SQL engine
- **Deployment:** Cloudflare Workers/Containers
- **Format:** Writes Parquet to R2, manages Iceberg metadata

### Cold Tier (R2 + Iceberg + Query Engine)
- **Storage:** Cloudflare R2 (zero egress fees)
- **Format:** Apache Iceberg (open standard)
- **Query Engine:** Distributed, serverless, metadata-driven pruning
- **Execution:** Apache DataFusion on Cloudflare edge

## When to Use Fig

### ✅ **Ideal Use Cases**

1. **Analytics on Historical Data**
   - Multi-year datasets
   - Ad-hoc exploration
   - Business intelligence
   - Compliance reporting

2. **Hybrid Operational + Analytical**
   - Need both fast recent queries AND deep historical queries
   - Real-time dashboards + historical trends
   - Single platform for all query types

3. **Cost-Conscious Organizations**
   - Want to reduce data platform costs 80%+
   - Pay for value (queries) not idle time (clusters)

4. **Open Data Strategy**
   - Want to own your data
   - No vendor lock-in
   - Interoperable with other tools

5. **Rapid Growth**
   - Data growing from GBs to TBs to PBs
   - Don't want to re-platform every year
   - Need infinite scale without re-architecture

### ❌ **Not Ideal For**

1. **Millisecond-Scale Requirements**
   - If you need <10ms queries on historical data
   - Use: ClickHouse or specialized OLAP DB

2. **Extreme Update Patterns**
   - Millions of random updates per second on old data
   - Iceberg supports updates, but optimized for append-mostly

3. **Complex Joins Across Hot/Cold**
   - If most queries join recent + old data
   - Consider: Materialize joined views to one tier

4. **Existing Spark/Trino Investment**
   - If you've already invested heavily in tuning Spark
   - Migration ROI may take time

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Risk:** Query engine doesn't scale to petabytes
   - **Mitigation:** POC validates approach, Cloudflare proves it at scale
   - **Fallback:** Can always use Trino as temporary query engine

2. **Risk:** CDC can't keep up with write volume
   - **Mitigation:** RisingWave is proven at scale, parallelize if needed
   - **Fallback:** Batch replication (acceptable with slightly higher lag)

3. **Risk:** Pruning efficiency lower than expected
   - **Mitigation:** Test with real data patterns in POC
   - **Fallback:** Create summary tables, optimize partitioning

### Operational Risks

1. **Risk:** Cloudflare service outage
   - **Mitigation:** Multi-region deployment, hot storage separate
   - **Fallback:** Fail over to hot storage for recent data queries

2. **Risk:** Data loss during migration
   - **Mitigation:** Parallel run phase, continuous validation
   - **Fallback:** Keep old system running during transition

3. **Risk:** Team lacks Rust/DataFusion expertise
   - **Mitigation:** Hire specialists, use consultants initially
   - **Fallback:** Start with simpler query engine (e.g., Python + DuckDB)

### Business Risks

1. **Risk:** Cost savings don't materialize
   - **Mitigation:** Track costs closely during POC and pilot
   - **Fallback:** ROI is secondary to operational simplicity

2. **Risk:** Migration takes longer than expected
   - **Mitigation:** Phased approach, incremental value delivery
   - **Fallback:** Pause migration, run hybrid temporarily
